# angular2Spotify

## Setup:

## Clone the repo

Clone this repo into new project folder (e.g., `my-proj`).
```bash
git clone  https://github.com/marcosocon/angular2Spotify  my-proj
cd my-proj
```

## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command first compiles the application,
then simultaneously re-compiles and runs the `lite-server`.
Both the compiler and the server watch for file changes.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

You're ready to run the  application.
